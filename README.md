# HandMovementClassifier
A Vicon motion capture camera system was used to record users performing 3 hand postures with markers attached to a left-handed glove. 
Markers with a rigid pattern on the glove was used to establish a local co-ordinate system. 
The goal of the classification task is to correctly predict the hand movements.
